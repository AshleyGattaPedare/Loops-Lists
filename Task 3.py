#The screen on the fridge will need to print out the list of ingredients availabel and suggest a recipe if certain ingredients are detected.

# Step 1: On line 5, set up a list called 'fridge_items' which has at least five different items you would find in a fridge.



# Step 2: On line 9, use a print statement to show 'Items currently in the fridge." On the following two lines, use a for loop to print all of the items in the fridge.

print
for 


# Step 3: Looking at the items in your list, use an if statement to check if two or three of the items can make a recipe. There's an example below. 

if "bacon" in fridge_items and "eggs" in fridge_items:
    print("You have bacon and eggs! How about cooking bacon and eggs?")
